# Caliburn.Light

Caliburn.Light is a fork of [Caliburn.Micro](http://caliburnmicro.com/) that
- is modular/magic-free (does not include conventions)
- does not switch to UI thread automatically for everything
- integrates some ideas of [Prism](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff648465.aspx) and [MVVMLight](http://www.mvvmlight.net/) 
- uses weak events (see [Weakly](https://github.com/tibel/Weakly))
- supports `ICommand` out-of-the-box
